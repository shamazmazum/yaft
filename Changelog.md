# Changelog

## Version 0.2

Cooley-Tukey is now inplace and supports only power-of-2 inputs. Bluestein
algorithm is used to reduce any-sized computations to power-of-2
computations.

* Improvement: Speed of computations is improved significantly in all use cases.
* Improvement: Benchmarks added.
* Improvement: Cons less in RFFT and Bluestein algorithms

## Version 0.1

* Basic FFT for one-dimensional inputs of any length.
